# MadhavSales_BI_Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard project


In this project I've created a Dashboard for the Sales report for Quarter Basis and Places.
We can interact with different parameters to get brief insights from Dashboard.

Here are the insight that I found:
• Created an interactive dashboard to monitor and evaluate statistics about online sales.

• Used sophisticated parameters to customize the worksheet and dive down using slicers and filters.

• Added connections, joined new tables, performed computations to work with data, and made user-driven parameters available for visualizations.

• Utilized a variety of specialized visualization formats, including as maps, slicers, clustered bar charts, pie charts, bar charts, and donut charts.
